                            <h4>Virginia Alison Jones</h4>
                            <p>Virginia Alison Jones is a 29-year-old scientific researcher who enjoys binge-watching boxed sets, chess and reading. She is smart and bright, but can also be very cowardly and a bit disloyal.
                                She is British who defines herself as straight. She has a degree in chemistry.
                                Physically, Virginia is in good shape. She is short with walnut skin, black hair and brown eyes.
                                She grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. She was raised by her mother, her father having left when she was young.
                                She is currently single. Her most recent romance was with a lab assistant called Wisdom Sierra Poole, who was 13 years older than her. They broke up because Virginia was sacred of commitment.
                                Virginia's best friend is a scientific researcher called Stanton Emerson. They get on well most of the time. She also hangs around with Larkin Glenn and Churchill Hodgson. They enjoy eating out together.
                                are inseparable. She also hangs around with Alex Duffy and Marvin Johnson. They enjoy stealing candy from babies together.</p>
