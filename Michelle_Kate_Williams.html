                            <h4>Michelle Kate Williams</h4>
                            <p>Michelle Kate Williams is a 21-year-old tea maker who enjoys painting, planking and listening to music. She is friendly and stable, but can also be very stingy and a bit boring.
                                She is an Irish Buddhist who defines herself as gay. She finished school and then left academia. She has a severe phobia of blood, and is obsessed with creating playlists.
                                Physically, Michelle is slightly overweight but otherwise in good shape. She is very tall with pale skin, black hair and black eyes. She has a tattoo of the Spotify logo on her lower back.
                                She grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. She was raised in a happy family home with two loving parents.
                                She is currently single. Her most recent romance was with a semi-professional sports person called Cory Callie Yates, who was 5 years older than her. They broke up because Cory was fed up of friends getting on better with Michelle.
                                Michelle's best friend is a tea maker called Greg Hope. They are inseparable. She also hangs around with Alex Duffy and Marvin Johnson. They enjoy stealing candy from babies together.</p>
